You are conducting a comprehensive audit to synchronize ROADMAP.md with GitHub repository state and actual project progress.

# CONTEXT

This is a fast-paced project with ~5 issues closed per day (25/week). Small deviations accumulate quickly:

- PRs split into multiple parts create extra issues
- Parent issues get decomposed into atomic sub-issues
- Orphan modules discovered during development
- Security/bugfix issues added mid-flight

Your job is to detect ALL discrepancies and provide actionable reconciliation steps.

# AUDIT SCOPE

## 1. ISSUE COUNT RECONCILIATION

**Compare:**

- Total issues in ROADMAP.md header (search for "Total: X issues")
- Actual GitHub issues count: `gh issue list --state all --limit 1000 | wc -l`

**Detect:**

- Phantom references (issues mentioned in ROADMAP but don't exist in GitHub)
- Orphan issues (exist in GitHub but not documented in ROADMAP)
- Closed issues not marked as completed in ROADMAP

**Output format:**

```
📊 ISSUE COUNT AUDIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
ROADMAP.md:        98 issues
GitHub (actual):   103 issues
Drift:             +5 issues (5.1%)
Status:            🟡 WARNING (>5% drift)

BREAKDOWN:
✅ Documented & exist:     93 issues
❌ Phantom (doc only):     5 issues → #49-#76 range (GHOST RANGE)
🆕 Orphan (GitHub only):   10 issues → #145, #146, #147...
```

---

## 2. MILESTONE PROGRESS VALIDATION

**For each milestone (M1-M6):**

**Compare:**

- ROADMAP.md stated progress (e.g., "M2: 10/10 (100%)")
- GitHub milestone actual state: `gh api repos/:owner/:repo/milestones`
- Issue references in ROADMAP vs. actual issue states

**Detect:**

- Closed issues still marked as open in ROADMAP
- Open issues marked as closed in ROADMAP
- Issues in wrong milestone
- Progress percentage mismatches

**Output format:**

```
📈 MILESTONE PROGRESS AUDIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

| Milestone | ROADMAP    | GitHub     | Sync | Issues                  |
|-----------|------------|------------|------|-------------------------|
| M1        | 34/34 100% | 34/34 100% | ✅   | Perfect sync            |
| M2        | 10/10 100% | 9/10  90%  | ❌   | #112 marked done, still open |
| M3        | 9/14  64%  | 10/14 71%  | ⚠️   | #85 closed, not marked  |
| M4        | 3/20  15%  | 3/20  15%  | ✅   | Perfect sync            |
| M5        | 1/17  6%   | 2/17  12%  | ⚠️   | #97 closed, not marked  |
| M6        | 0/2   0%   | 0/2   0%   | ✅   | Perfect sync            |

CRITICAL ISSUES:
❌ M2: Issue #112 marked as closed in ROADMAP but still OPEN in GitHub
⚠️  M3: Issue #85 is CLOSED in GitHub but marked OPEN in ROADMAP
⚠️  M5: Issue #97 is CLOSED in GitHub but marked OPEN in ROADMAP
```

---

## 3. ISSUE STATE SYNCHRONIZATION

**For EVERY issue referenced in ROADMAP:**

**Check:**

1. Does issue exist in GitHub? `gh issue view #N`
2. Is state correct? (open/closed match ROADMAP checkboxes)
3. Is milestone assignment correct?
4. Are labels consistent?

**Detect:**

- [ ] marked but issue is closed → outdated ROADMAP
- [x] marked but issue is open → premature closure documented
- Issue moved to different milestone → ROADMAP outdated

**Output format:**

```
🔍 ISSUE STATE AUDIT (Detailed)
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

DISCREPANCIES FOUND: 8

M1 (100% claimed, VALID):

## 4. PHANTOM REFERENCE DETECTION

**Scan ROADMAP.md for:**

- Issue numbers that don't exist: `#49-#76` (you already found this)
- References to issues in descriptions/notes that are invalid
- Broken cross-references between issues

**Output format:**

```
👻 PHANTOM REFERENCES AUDIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

CRITICAL: 14 phantom issues detected!

Line 145: "Issues #49-#76 (14 issues)"
├─ Reality: These issues DO NOT EXIST in GitHub
├─ Likely cause: Typo in range, should be #50-#63
├─ Impact: ROADMAP claims 98 issues, actual is 84 (-14)
└─ Action: Replace "#49-#76" with "#50-#63" everywhere

Line 423: "See issue #200 for details"
├─ Reality: Issue #200 does not exist (max issue: #147)
├─ Action: Find correct issue number or remove reference

Line 891: "Blocked by #999"
├─ Reality: Issue #999 does not exist
├─ Action: Verify blocking issue and update reference
```

---

## 5. ORPHAN ISSUE DETECTION

**Find issues in GitHub NOT documented in ROADMAP:**

**Query:** `gh issue list --state all --json number,title,state,milestone`

**Cross-reference:** Every issue number against ROADMAP.md content

**Output format:**

```
🆕 ORPHAN ISSUES AUDIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

FOUND: 5 orphan issues (exist in GitHub, missing in ROADMAP)

#145 - [SECURITY] Fix HIGH vulnerability in dompurify

## 6. VELOCITY & ETA VALIDATION

**Calculate:**

- Issues closed last 7 days
- Average velocity (issues/day)
- Projected completion dates for milestones

**Compare against:** ROADMAP stated ETAs

**Output format:**

```
⏱️  VELOCITY & ETA AUDIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

ACTUAL VELOCITY (Last 7 days):
├─ Issues closed: 32 issues
├─ Average: 4.6 issues/day
├─ Trend: Accelerating (was 3.8/day 2 weeks ago)
└─ Efficiency: 115% of planned (target: 4/day)

MILESTONE ETA VALIDATION:

M2 (90% → 100%):
├─ ROADMAP ETA: 2025-11-27
├─ Remaining: 1 issue (#112)
├─ Projected: 2025-11-18 (TODAY at current velocity!)
└─ Status: 🟢 AHEAD OF SCHEDULE by 9 days

M3 (64% → 100%):
├─ ROADMAP ETA: 2025-12-04
├─ Remaining: 5 issues (if #85, #17 marked correctly)
├─ Projected: 2025-11-19 (1.1 days at current velocity)
└─ Status: 🟢 AHEAD OF SCHEDULE by 15 days

M4 (15% → 100%):
├─ ROADMAP ETA: 2025-12-18
├─ Remaining: 17 issues
├─ Projected: 2025-11-22 (3.7 days at current velocity)
└─ Status: 🟢 AHEAD OF SCHEDULE by 26 days!

⚠️  RECOMMENDATION: ETAs in ROADMAP are VERY conservative. Consider:
- Updating ETAs to reflect actual velocity
- Compressing timeline to maintain momentum
- Adding stretch goals to M3/M4 to fill time
```

---

## 7. DOCUMENTATION CONSISTENCY CHECK

**Verify:**

- Progress bars in ROADMAP match calculated percentages
- "X issues closed" text matches actual closed count
- Milestone descriptions reference correct issue ranges
- Update dates are current

**Output format:**

```
📝 DOCUMENTATION CONSISTENCY AUDIT
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

HEADER SECTION:
❌ Line 12: "Total: 98 issues (40 open + 58 closed)"
   └─ Reality: 103 total (35 open + 68 closed)
   └─ Action: Update to "Total: 103 issues (35 open + 68 closed)"

PROGRESS BARS:
❌ Line 15: M3 shows "█████████████░░░░░░░ 9/14 (64%)"
   └─ Reality: Should be "██████████████░░░░░░ 10/14 (71%)"
   └─ Action: Update progress bar + percentage

❌ Line 18: M5 shows "█░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 1/17 (6%)"
   └─ Reality: Should be "██░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░░ 2/17 (12%)"
   └─ Action: Update progress bar + percentage

UPDATE TIMESTAMPS:
⚠️  Line 8: "Última Atualização: 2025-11-16"
   └─ Reality: Today is 2025-11-18
   └─ Action: Update to current date

MILESTONE SUMMARIES:
✅ M1 summary accurate (34/34, 100%)
✅ M2 summary accurate (10/10, 100%) - assuming #112 gets closed
❌ M3 summary outdated (claims 9/14, should be 10/14)
✅ M4 summary accurate (3/20, 15%)
❌ M5 summary outdated (claims 1/17, should be 2/17)
✅ M6 summary accurate (0/2, 0%)
```
